    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    
    <h2>What does this policy cover?</h2>
    <p>This Policy applies to all Services that we offer via our entire suite of apps, and also applies to this Website as well. This Policy does not apply to any website, product or service of any third-party company even if the website links to (or from) our Website. Please always review the privacy practices of any third-party company before deciding whether to provide any information. By using our Website or Services, you are accepting the practices described in this Policy. If you do not agree with this Policy, please do not visit or use our Website or Services. Your continued use of our Website or Services will signify your acceptance of this Policy.</p>
    
    <h2>What data do we collect?</h2>
    <p>Our products only support anonymous use and users are not required to register or submit any personal information. We do not record any of your personal information.</p>
    
    <h3>Anonymous Information ("Non-personal Data"):</h3>
    <p>We collect and/or receive and store certain non-personal information ("Non-personal Data") whenever you interact with Secure Signal Products, including without limitation, data relating to the system you are using, mobile/desktop device, general properties and metadata, OS version, preferred language, the date and time of your visit, Google Advertising ID, Connectivity (WLAN), Mobile service provider. We collect such statistical information about usage as aggregate data in order to maintain a better customer experience as well as a high level of quality for the Service.</p>
    <p>With regards to the Secure Signal Products, Non-personal Data is not associated with or linked to your Personal Information. Thus Non-personal Data does not permit the identification of individual persons. Additionally, Non-personal Data does not include any information about the activity performed by the user inside Secure Signal Products such as browsing history, web content accessed, destinations of VPN traffic, DNS queries and IP addresses. We use this information for internal monitoring, analytics, and improvement of our services in the way described in this Policy. Additionally, at your sole discretion, you may approve VPN connection diagnostics which allows for app data to be sent by the user to the customer support team, similarly to a "report a bug" feature. A connection log may also be sent together with a ticket that is raised with our customer support, so our team can debug any faults that may appear and result in a bad experience for the user.</p>
    
    <h2>How do we collect non-personal data?</h2>
    <h3>Secure Signal Products</h3>
    <p>In order to ensure the quality of our services, we need to constantly adjust our global infrastructure, so we collect statistical non-personal information to build aggregate data and understand overall user trends. Few examples of events are indicatively mentioned below:</p>
    <h4>Connection Attempt:</h4>
    <p>We collect this information to know the usage request directed to our Service on a particular hourly/daily/weekly/monthly interval, the country of origin (but not your source IP address), your app version, etc. This metric allows us to properly adjust our infrastructure according to the demand.</p>
    <h4>Connection Successful:</h4>
    <p>We collect this information to know how many users per hourly/daily/weekly/monthly intervals successfully established VPN connections to our service. This information correlated with the above event results, helps our engineers determine if there are any network issues which might prevent users from starting the service, identify peak hour intervals for our service so we can have the infrastructure scaled to meet the requests, etc.</p>
    
    <h3>Google Firebase</h3>
    <p>In order to provide a reliable and high-quality service, we have integrated Google Firebase, a proven and secure third-party library, to build our product. For more information, see Firebase’s Privacy Policy at: <a href="https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy">https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy</a></p>
    
    <h2>Service Performance Data and Connection Summary Statistics</h2>
    <p>Through our strict no-logs-policy, we ensure that we do NOT track user traffic performed inside the VPN tunnel such as: browsing history, traffic destination, search preferences, data content, IP addresses or DNS queries. Therefore:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>We do NOT know at any time which user ever accessed a particular website or service</li>
        <li>We do NOT know which user was connected to our service at any given time or which server IP they used</li>
        <li>We do NOT know the set of original IP addresses of a user’s computer</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Secure Signal is 100% committed to the no-logs-policy and we do not store them.</p>
    
    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>You represent and warrant that you are at least 16 years of age and of legal competence to use our Service. If you are under 18, please be sure to read the Agreement with your parents or legal guardians. We do not use the Service to knowingly solicit data from or market to children under the age of sixteen (16).</p>
    
    <h2>Data Retention</h2>
    <p>We may rectify, replenish or remove incomplete or inaccurate information, at any time and at our own discretion as detailed above. Please note that unless you instruct us otherwise we retain the information we collect for as long as needed to provide the Service and to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes and enforce our agreements.</p>
